Marking guide for COMP3420 assignment 2, 2016
=============================================

General comment for students: Please follow exactly the questions asked
  in assignment specifications, as otherwise it is very hard to do an
  accurate marking!

We deducted -1 mark if you left your submission in draft status rather than
submitting a final version.

We also deducted marks for submissions longer than the maximum 10 pages
(as clearly stated in the assignment specifications).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

***** Task 1: 5 marks *****

      The output should follow exactly the example given.

      0.5 mark: correct and complete length 2 frequent item-sets (part 2)

      0.5 mark: correct and complete length 3 frequent item-sets (part 3)

      0.5 mark: correct and complete length 4 candidate item-sets (part 4)

      0.5 mark: correct pruning with correct reasons why pruning occurred 
	(the missing 3-item sets) or why no pruning was necessary (part 4).
	-0.25 if counting of 4 item-sets done here, instead of later.

      0.5 mark: correct and complete length 4 frequent item-sets (part 4)  
	Note this can possibly be an empty set!

      1 mark:   correct and complete rules generated (frequent rules of
	length 3 from the alphabetically sorted first two large 3-item sets) 
	and their correct support values (part 5)

      0.5 mark: correct confidence values for these rules (part 5)
      1 mark:   correct lift values for these rules (part 5)

      Also:
      -0.25 mark for each counting error/missing item set.
      -1 mark if the initial database was not generated correctly.
      
      If a counting error led to later mistakes (with confidence/lift, etc)
	students were not penalised twice, provided later results were
	consistent with previous incorrect results.

  If a student made a mistake when generating the database, then we had
  to manually check the rest of their task 5 submission.

  No workings beyond what is given in the example output are needed.

***** Task 2: 4 marks *****

  Each Technique was worth 1 mark.
  For part 4 of each technique, we wanted you to give an example
  application where the clustering algorithm either: overcomes some
  of the specific difficulties with the application, or makes use
  of the particular strengths of the algorithm (or does both).

  (a) AGNES
      (1) distance measure to calculate distance between data points,
          distance measure to calculate distance between clusters, and
          either number of clusters to generate or minimum cluster
          similarity.
      (2) To some degree depends upon distance functions used, but
          mostly spherical clusters only.
      (3) Limitation on data depends upon distance function(s) used.
          Can be sensitive to noise and outliers (single and complete
          link cluster distances).
          Algorithm can never undo a merge of two clusters.
          Has quadratic computational complexity in number of data
          points, so not really scalable.
          Every point in the data sets will be included in a cluster.
      (4) Any application that requires a hierarchical clustering of
          the data, e.g. character recognition (similar looking
          letters in a cluster), consumer data, biological data
          (hierarchies of animal/plant clusters) based on features
          (descriptions of animals).

  (b) CLARA
      (1) Only spherical clusters - depends upon distance measure used
          for categorical data.
      (2) Distance measure to calculate distance between data points,
          k=number of clusters, s=size of sample to use
      (3) The number of clusters must be specified; depending upon
          distance function used it can be limited to low-dimensional
          data (curse of dimensionality), uses random sampling, so
          might not get 'best' clustering.
          Every point in the data sets will be included in a cluster.
      (4) Applications with data of both numerical and categorical
          types, such as customer data, product data, census data with
          attributes such as marital status, education, salary, etc.

  (c) DBSCAN
      (1) Any shape of clusters, depending upon density parameters.
      (2) epsilon neighbourhood, and minpts (to include a point into a
          cluster), and distance function (for distance between data
          points).
      (3) Depending upon distance measure used, it might not work well
          with high-dimensional data, some randomness in how first
          data point is selected. Some difficulties in data sets with
          clusters that have very different densities (i.e. epsilon
          and minpts are global parameters).
      (4) Applications where data are very noisy, e.g. outlier
          detection (outliers are those points not in dense regions).

  (d) k-means
      (1) k=number of clusters, max number of iterations or another
          stopping criteria, distance function to be used.
      (2) Only spherical clusters can be found.
      (3) Only applicable on numerical data where mean can be
          calculated; number of clusters must be specified; with
          Euclidean distance it is limited to low-dimensional data
          (curse of dimensionality).
          Every point in the data sets will be included in a cluster.
      (4) For example financial data, numerical scientific data
          (e.g. astronomy), geographical data, image data
          (images represented as numerical features). k-means is widely
	  used in many areas, despite its limitations.

***** Task 3: 4 marks *****

  Part (a):
      1 mark: Correct confusion matrix, including 'Total' number and
	normalised confusion matrix (percentages). 0.5 mark each.

      1 mark: Correct accuracy and error rate percentage numbers.
	0.5 mark each.

      1 mark: Correct specificity, precision, recall and f-measure
        as percentage numbers. 0.25 mark each.

      Workings are needed for the formulas. If only the results are
      shown but not the formulas then do not award a mark for this
      part, if only the formulas but not the numerical values inserted
      into the formulas are shown deduct -0.25 (from 1 mark) for parts
      2 and 3.

      If a student made a mistake when generating the confusion
      matrix (part 1), then we had to manually check the rest of
      their task 2 submission.

  Part (b):
      0.5 mark:  Correct balance ratio.

      0.5 mark:  If the problem is imbalanced, accuracy is not suitable 
	as it will be too high - many TN values due to class imbalance. 
        Precision and recall are better as they do not include TN in
        the equation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

***** Task 4: 2 marks *****

  (a) Age=Young, Gender=Male, Employed=Yes, Student=No, Has car=No,
      Class = Neg
        Gender = Male -> Age = Young -> Pos
        D-TRee output: Pos -> False Positive

  (b) Age=Old, Gender=Male, Employed=Yes, Student=Yes, Has car=No,
      Class=Neg
        Gender = Male -> Age = Old -> Has Car = No -> Neg
        D-TRee output: Neg -> True Negative

  (c) Age=Young, Gender=Female, Employed=Yes, Student=No, Has car=No,
      Class=Neg
        Gender = Female -> Student = No -> Neg
        D-TRee output: Neg -> True negative

  (d) Age=Middle, Gender=Female, Employed=Yes, Student=Yes,
      Has car=Yes, Class=Pos
        Gender = Female -> Student = Yes -> Employed = Yes -> Neg
        D-TRee output: Neg -> False negative

  0.5 mark for each correct answer, with the decision of why this
       answer included (workings).

  No mark if only the outcome (TN, FN, etc.) but no workings shown.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

***** Task 5 (data mining project): 5 marks *****

      (a) Data Exploration. 1 Mark.
          The data exploration needs to include:
           - number of records in the data set
           - number of attributes in the data set
           - types (numerical, categorical (ordinal, nominal, etc.)
           - data distributions for numerical attributes
           - number of categories for categorical attributes
           - description of missing values
           - some other statistical measures, correlation plots, etc

          A table listing all attributes and their types would be the
          best answer.

          -1 if text copied directly from UCI (you might have to
             check) and not attributed/cited

          -0.5 marks if only some attributes are described, or
               types are not given, etc.

         -0.5 marks if they did not describe what the data set
              is and why it was collected.

         -0.5 marks if the description is "then I clicked on
              the 'Execute button'..", etc.

         -0.5  marks if no correlation plot, no mentioning of
               mean, mode, median etc., no mentioning of skewness,
               no Benford etc. is given. 

         Which measures are interesting/appropriate varies from
         data set to data set, main emphasis is on analysis and
         justification.

      (b) Data cleaning and transformation: 1 Mark
          Description of the reasoning behind any cleaning and/or
          transformation, or if not done then a reason why no
          cleaning or transformation was needed. (Example of
          transformation is normalisation in 0..1 interval)

         -0.5 if no clear explanation is given why or why no
              transformation was done.

         -0.5 if no normalisation is done but un-normalised data
              are later used in an algorithm that would required
              normalised values (e.g k-means).

         -0.5 if only some variables were used without a
              justification given why (or the justification is not
              well explained).

         -0.5  If description given is wrong in some way.

         -0.25 or more if description given is too brief, unclear,
               messy, etc.

      (c) Data mining algorithm(s) used: 2 Marks
          Again, some description why a certain algorithm was used,
          how it was used (parameter settings?), what the intention
          was, etc.

         -0.5 if no description is given why a certain algorithm
              was used.

         -1.0 if no discussion about parameter settings/inputs.

         -0.5 if no discussion of evaluation measures and reasons.

         -1 if algorithm used incorrectly (i.e. clustering used to
            do classification).

         -0.25 (or more) if descriptions are wrong, too brief, messy,
               unclear, etc.

      (d) Outcomes of your project: 1 Mark
          A presentation of results in the form of description of
          classes, rules, clusters, error matrices, or graphics such
          as ROC or risk curves, etc. plus some description of the
          results.

          -0.5 marks if only plots or an error matrix is given with
               out any description.

         -0.5 if no figures or tables are included but only textual
              description.

         -0.25 (or more) if results are incorrect, poorly interpreted,
               unclear, messy, inappropriate, etc.


      -1 if the data set name, and source URL not clearly presented
         at the start of Task 5, or in the answer to part (a).

      -1 if a data set which we already used in tutorials was selected.
